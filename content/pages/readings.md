Several of the readings came from the lecture notes on Intensional Semantics:

\[Intensional Semantics\] = von Fintel, Kai, and Irene Heim. Lecture notes. "Intensional Semantics." http://kaivonfintel.org/teaching/. ([PDF](http://mit.edu/fintel/fintel-heim-intensional.pdf))

Interspersed between these chapters were papers, presentations, and working papers. The readings were covered approximately in the order listed.
